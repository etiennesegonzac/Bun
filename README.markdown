# Bun: a simple Todo list synced between all your devices

## The Goal
A simple, open source, todo list app working everywhere you have a modern browser (not just WebKit), with offline & sync capabilities.

## Technologies
HTML5 I gues...

*  HTML
*  Some CSS3 goodness
*  JavaScript (with a touch of Zepto)
*  IndexedDB
*  CouchDB on the server side

## Progress
We just started prototyping.

But what's the point of open source if you're not doing it in the open? :)
